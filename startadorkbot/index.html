What, there's no dorkbot in your city? Well then maybe you should start 
one!
<p>
<h3>Some things to consider:</h3>
<p>
<b>What is dorkbot, exactly?</b>: Each dorkbot is different and is 
driven by the needs and interests of people in the local community. But 
generally, the main goals of dorkbot are: to create an informal, friendly 
environment in which people can talk about the work they're doing and to 
foster discussion about that work; to help bring together people from 
different backgrounds who are interested in similar things; to give us 
all an opportunity to see the strange things our neighbors are doing with 
electricity. dorkbot isn't really a forum for formal artist talks or lectures, 
but rather a chance for diverse people to have friendly conversations about
interesting ideas.

The organizers of Pixelache 2008 asked <a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~douglas"
class="link">Douglas</a> to talk about dorkbot's "organisational strategy".

<p>
<b>Frequency</b>: How often will you hold meetings? Some dorkbots have 
meetings 
every month, others just a few times a year. It's a lot of work putting 
the meetings together, and in smaller cities is can be difficult to 
schedule enough speakers. You don't want to burn out! 
<p>
<b>Locale</b>: If you are in a smaller city or town, you might want to consider
collaborating with people in other nearby cities/towns. Maybe the dorkbot meeting
can travel to a different location each month, or maybe you can all pool your 
resources for a couple long-form meetings each season.
<p>
<b>Venue</b>: Is there a place to hold the meetings? It can be very 
convenient to 
have the meetings in the same place each time. Often an art gallery or 
performance space will be willing to donate their facilities for the 
occassional meeting. If you know someone connected to a university you may 
be able to get a space through them. It doesn't have to be a fancy space! 
<p>
<b>Equipment</b>: Do you have access to presentation equipment? At the 
least 
you'll probably need a video projector, a small sound system, and a 
network connection. A laptop computer can also make things easier on the 
presenters. As with the venue, it's best if you can use the same equipment 
at each meeting. It can be very stressful trying to track down a video 
projector the day of a dorkbot meeting! Often the venue you use will have 
A/V equipment you can borrow.
<p>
<b>$$$</b>: dorkbot is a non-$-oriented organization. dorkbot meetings are 
generally free events, so you need to be careful about spending lots of 
money to produce them! Several dorkbots sell beer and/or food at the 
meetings to help cover their costs. Make sure you talk to the venue 
before selling anything. dorkbot.org donates web space, email lists, etc. 
to the local dorkbots, so there is no administrative cost associated with 
setting up a new dorkbot.
<p>
<b>Meeting Format</b>: dorkbot meetings are rather informal. There are 
usually two or three presentations (about 20-30 minutes each) per meeting 
and sometimes very short "lightening" presentations from 
audience members. The specific format is up to each organizer to decide. 
You'll probably have to play with your format for a few meetings until you 
find something that works well in your context. One thing to keep in mind
is that the dorkbot format works best for informal, conversational 
presentations on a particular work or topic, rather than formal artist 
talks or lectures on a body of work. 30 minutes isn't much time, so 
focused presentations work best.
